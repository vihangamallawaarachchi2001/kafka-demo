# Real-Time Event Processing with Kafka and Redis

A local development stack for building event-driven applications using:
- **Apache Kafka** (KRaft mode — no ZooKeeper!)
- **Redis** (with AOF persistence for real-time state)

Perfect for prototyping streaming analytics, clickstream processing, or real-time dashboards.

- Python 3.8+ (for producer/processor scripts)
